#data types

#int - numbers
#float - numbers with decimal points
#strings - ordered sequence of chatacters
#list - equivilant of JS arrays
#dict - Key value pairs, like objects. First look like JSON.
#tup (tuples) - ordered, immutable sequence of objects: (10, 'hello', 200.3). Can't be changed;
#set (sets) - unordered collection of items, no key value pairs but they are unique.
#bool - booleans. True and False need to be capitalized.

#Numbers - int and float
#basically the same thing
#modulo also in python
# power is denoted with **
#order of ops works as well

#variables
#variable names cant start with number, cant have spaces, cant use weird symbols
#names should be lowercase and dont use words that have a special meaning in python
#python uses dynamic typing
#can reassign variables to different data types, this works in javascript too
